# Candyland deck shuffler

This is a dead-simple replacement for the deck of cards in Candyland. My oldest loves playing the game, but the cards are starting to get bent and ragged around the edges. I threw this together in 45 minutes as an easy replacement.

## Usage

1. Download the "candyland-deck.html" file.
2. Open it directly in your browser (no need to host it).
3. The first card will already be drawn and displayed. Press spacebar to draw another card.

## Notes

- This keeps the same distribution of cards as the deck which comes with the game (or at least the version of the game that we bought in 2019).
- If you draw all the cards in the deck, the deck will automatically be reshuffled in the background.
- The "Reshuffle" button manually generates a fresh random deck. Use this to start a new game.
- The "Help" button is a misnomer, and it's sneaky. It actually causes the next card to be a less helpful one (a single colored square). This only works if there's a single-colored square in your deck still. Use this button at your own parenting judgment; I use it because while I want my daughter to learn how to lose, I also don't want her to get absolutely clobbered. This helps me slow down a bit if I'm in the lead.
- The appearance of the emojis might differ between platform, and won't look exactly like your game. For clarity, here's the specific emojis and what they are:
  - Ice cream cone: üç®
  - Peppermint (the most ambiguous): üç¨
  - Lollipop: üç≠
  - Peanut: ü•ú
